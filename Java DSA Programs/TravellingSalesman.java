/*Consider a Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) with 4 cities, where the distance between the cities are given by an adjacency matrix. Using dynamic programming with bitmasking, what is the length of the shortest path that visits all 4 cities and returns to the starting city (city 0) ?
 * 
 * Input: City: 0  1  2  3
 *           0  0  10 15 20
 *           1  10 0  35 25
 *           2  15 35 0  30
 *           3  20 25 30 0
 * Output: 80
 * 
 * Input: City: 0  1  2  3  4
 *           0  0  10 15 20 25
 *           1  10 0  35 45 30
 *           2  15 35 0  50 40
 *           3  20 45 50 0  55
 *           4  25 30 40 55 0
 * Output: 110
